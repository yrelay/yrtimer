Place your default sound files here (e.g., bell.oga).

Notes:
- You can use Ogg Vorbis (.oga/.ogg) or WAV files.
- The preferences let you pick an absolute path as well. If a file is inside this `sounds/` folder, only the filename will be stored in settings.
- This folder is optional. If empty, the extension will try system sounds (Freedesktop theme) as fallback.
